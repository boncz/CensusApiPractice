# API request practice using data from census.gov

### As I learn more, I hope to find new ways to interpret data collections and model my findings. 

So far, through these practice projects I am learning:
+ creating api requests
+ making and viewing dataframes using pandas
+ working with reading/writing csv files and using JSON
